If you want to create the PDFs that include the maps and plots, then a zip file of the PDFs is [here](https://github.com/lexcomber/LexTrainingR/blob/master/The%20Intermediate%20R%20course%20PDFs.zip) *or* you could right click on the links above, save the `.RMD` files, open them in RStudio and click on the `Knit PDF` icon.
